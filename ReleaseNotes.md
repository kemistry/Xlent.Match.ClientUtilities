# ClientUtilities release history

## 3.2 (2014-09-15)

* CHANGE: Now uses the same version numbers as Match. Can be abandoned later, but makes sense now when Match is where we do the major part of the development right now.
* CHANGE: Now uses async as much as possible for Service Bus.

## 1.1 (2014-08-11)

* CHANGE: The AdapterSubscription now has ReceiveMode set to ReceiveAndDelete.
